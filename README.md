# node-rfswitch
Control RF outlets from nodejs.

This library was inspired by [node-rcswitch](https://github.com/marvinroger/node-rcswitch) but instead of creating bindings for [rcswitch-pi](https://github.com/r10r/rcswitch-pi) this library uses [node-rpio](https://github.com/jperkin/node-rpio) to control the GPIO.
